**This code is written to complete the application procedure to QOSF program.**

# How to use the code?
To give a try, compile *init.py* script!
The code consists of two main modules:

1. *decomposition.py*: includes some tools to find Pauli's decomposition of 'H' matrix.
2. *vqe.py*: is the main script where hybrid variational method is used to approximate the lowest eigenvalue.

# Task 4

Find the lowest eigenvalue of the following matrix:

[[1, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, -1, 0],
  [0, -1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1]]

using VQE-like circuits, created by yourself from scratch.
